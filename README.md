# Migrating Monolithic Web Applications to Microservice Architectures Considering Dependencies on Databases and Views
 
This package includes the datasets utilized in the study mentioned in the paper.

## Subject web applications
+ ### [JPetStore2](https://github.com/KimJongSung/jPetStore)
    - JPetStore2 is a full web application that provides an online pet store system, built on the frameworks Spring 3 and MyBatis 2.
+ ### [JPetStore6](https://github.com/mybatis/jpetstore-6)
    - JPetStore6 is another version of JPetStore2, built on Spring 5, MyBatis 3, and Stripes.
+ ### [PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
    - PetClinic is a veterinary clinic information system built on Spring Boot, using Spring Data JPA for database interaction and Thymeleaf for the user interface. 
+ ### [ShoppingApp](https://github.com/manhduydl/Shopping-web-Jsp-Servlet)
    - ShoppingApp is a small online store system  based on the JSP Model 2 architecture.
+ ### [DayTrader](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.daytrader7)
    - DayTrader is an online stock trading system based on the JsP Model 2 architecture, using Java EE, JSF, EJB, and JDBC.
## Project structure
+ ### Ground truths
  This folder contains the microservice identification results provided by web app experts for the subject web applications.
  In the ground truths, each of labels indicates a particular service.
  
    - **JPetStore**\
  0 (Order service), 1 (Account service), 2 (Cart service), 3 (Catalog service), C (Common component), N/U (Not used)
    - **JPetStore**\
      0 (Order service), 1 (Account service), 2 (Cart service), 3 (Catalog service), C (Common component)
    - **PetClinic**\
