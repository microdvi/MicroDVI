## The Meanings of labels "C" and "N/U" in the ground truths.
+ ### "C": Common component
    - A common component is a web component used by multiple microservices.
    - Therefore, in this paper, it does not matter which microservice the common component is allocated to by the microservice identification techniques.
+ ### "N/U": Not used
    - "N/U" indicates a component that is not used in the web app.
    - Thus, like the common component, this paper does not care about the assignment of unused components to microservices.
